This app uses shinypods to:

- upload and parse a delimited file into a dataframe.
- if that dataframe has time-indexed data, plots it using dygraphs.

If you need such a csv file, here is a sample [data file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ijlyttle/shinypod/master/inst/extdata/wx_ames.csv), describing weather observations in Ames, Iowa (USA) for a month.

For more information on shinypods, please see the [Github repository](https://github.com:ijlyttle/shinypod).
