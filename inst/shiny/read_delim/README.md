This is a very simple (if not functional) app that uses a shinypod to upload and parse a delimited file into a dataframe.

To see this functionality combined with a dygraph, [another app](https://ijlyttle.shinyapps.io/read_delim_dygraph/) that uses shinypods is offered.

For more information on shinypods, please see the [Github repository](https://github.com:ijlyttle/shinypod).
